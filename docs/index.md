## Logging In

You can access the AWS console by starting from [CDCR launch page](https://cdcr.awsapps.com/start#/). You must have a role tied to the account you're logging in with. The role groups used with AWS are located in Active Directory in the accounts.cdcr.ca.gov\CDCR\Apps\AWS organizational unit.
