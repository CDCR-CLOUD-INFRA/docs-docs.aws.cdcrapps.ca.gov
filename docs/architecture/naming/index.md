# Overview
It's important to have a consistent style and naming for resources and other objects. This makes it easier for other team members to understand the purpose of an object.

# AWS Resources
The [AWS Resources](aws.md) page defines how resources created in AWS should be named, styled, and tagged.

# Terraform Resources
The [Terraform Resources](terraform.md) page defines how resources in your Terraform source code should be styled and named.
